- [ ] Google Search integration works (if configured)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

### What Won't Work on Vercel
- [ ] Image analysis (OCR) - Tesseract not supported
- [ ] Large file uploads (>4MB)
- [ ] Long processing times (>10 seconds)
- [ ] System-level dependencies

### What Works on Vercel
- [ ] Text analysis and fact-checking
- [ ] Audio transcription and analysis
- [ ] Document analysis (basic)
- [ ] Enhanced fact-checking with APIs
- [ ] All API endpoints
- [ ] Beautiful UI and responsive design

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Build Fails**
   - [ ] Check `requirements.txt` has all dependencies
   - [ ] Verify Python version in `runtime.txt`
   - [ ] Check for syntax errors in code

2. **Environment Variables Not Working**
   - [ ] Verify variable names are correct (case-sensitive)
   - [ ] Redeploy after adding environment variables
   - [ ] Check Vercel dashboard for variable status

3. **API Errors**
   - [ ] Verify API keys are valid
   - [ ] Check API quotas and limits
   - [ ] Test API keys locally first

4. **Function Timeout**
   - [ ] Optimize code for faster processing
   - [ ] Reduce file sizes
   - [ ] Consider Vercel Pro for longer timeouts

## üìä Monitoring

### Vercel Dashboard
- [ ] Check Function Logs for errors
- [ ] Monitor API usage and costs
- [ ] Review performance metrics
- [ ] Set up error alerts

### Health Monitoring
- [ ] Set up health check monitoring
